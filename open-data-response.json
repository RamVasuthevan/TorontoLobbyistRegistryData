The main instrument for doing this is the Lobbyist Registry which is an online, searchable tool that documents all lobbying activities in the City of Toronto. There are three different types of lobbyists (consultant, in-house and voluntary). The dataset is set up by subject matter; the lobbyist must register a subject matter before being approved for the Lobbyist Registry. This dataset contains the approved lobbyists within this registry.\r\n\r\nDespite the Lobbyist Registrar's authority to verify and clarify the information submitted to the System, it is the lobbyists' exclusive responsibility to ensure that all submitted information is accurate and correct and the information submitted by lobbyists to the System may be posted as received and the City of Toronto provides the System on an \"as is\", \"as available\", basis. The City does not make any express or implied warranties, representations or endorsements with respect to the system, including but not limited to, warranties as to usefulness, completeness, accuracy and reliability and the City will not accept any responsibility for data improperly entered. In addition, the City does not represent and warrant that the system will be available or meet your requirements, that access will be uninterrupted, that there will be no delays, failures or errors or omissions or loss of transmitted information, that no viruses or other contaminating or destructive properties will be transmitted or that no damage will occur to your computer system. As a user of the System, you accept sole responsibility for adequate protection and backup of your data, hardware and software and to take reasonable and appropriate precautions against viruses and other contaminating or destructive properties.\r\n",
